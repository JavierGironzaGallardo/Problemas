You are given an integer n, there is a n Ã— n chessboard with a Knight starting at the top-left corner (0, 0). Your task is to determine a valid Knight's Tour, where the Knight visits every square exactly once, following the standard movement rules of a chess Knight (two steps in one direction and one step perpendicular), for example if a Knight is placed at cell (2, 2), in one move it can move to any of the following cells: (4, 3), (4, 1), (0, 3), (0, 1), (3, 4), (3, 0), (1, 4) and (1, 0).

You have to return the order in which each cell is visited. If a solution exists, return the sequence of numbers (starting from 0) representing the order of visited squares. If no solution is possible, return an empty list.

Note: You can return any valid ordering, if it is correct the driver code will print true else it will print false.
